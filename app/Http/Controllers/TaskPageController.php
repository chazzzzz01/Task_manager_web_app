/**
 * The TaskPageController is a simple Laravel controller that loads the Dashboard.vue component using Inertia.
 * When a logged-in user visits the dashboard route, this controller's index() method runs. 
 * It uses Auth::user()->tasks() to fetch all tasks belonging to the current user and orders them by the latest created first. 
 * The tasks are then passed to the Vue component named Dashboard, where they can be displayed in a table or list. 
 * This controller acts like a bridge between Laravel (back-end) and Vue (front-end).
 *
